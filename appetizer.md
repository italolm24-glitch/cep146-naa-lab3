# No-Bake Jalapeno Popper Cheese Balls with Bacon & Chives by Fanny Slater

## Ingredients
* 1-pound bacon
* 10-ounces plain cream cheese, softened
* 1 tablespoon sour cream
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
* 1/4 cup minced jalapeno, seeded
* 1/2 cup sharp white cheddar, shredded
* 2 small shallots, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon onion powder

## Instructions
1. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 8-10 minutes, and then set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to soak up any excess oil. Once cooled, finely chop the bacon and place it in a wide shallow bowl.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the cream cheese, sour cream, chives, jalapenos, cheddar, shallots, salt, garlic powder and onion powder until throughly combined. Season to taste with salt and then refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
3. Using a tablespoon or small cookie scoop as your guide, portion out a small amount of the filling and form it into a ball. Roll the cheese ball through the bacon and repeat until all of the mixture is gone.
4. Refrigerate until you're ready to serve.
